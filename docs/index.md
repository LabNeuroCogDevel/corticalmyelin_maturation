## Image Processing Pipeline: UNI and R1

### Organization and Curation of BIDS
Structural data dicoms from the Luna-7T Brain Mechanisms project were first organized into {subject}/{session} organization (required for heudiconv) with the script [/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/organize_dicoms_forBIDS.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/organize_dicoms_forBIDS.sh). These dicoms were then converted to niftis according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure via heudiconv (version 0.13.1). Specifically, data were BIDSifyed using the [/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/7TBrainMech_MP2RAGE_heuristic.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/7TBrainMech_MP2RAGE_heuristic.py) heuristic and the [/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/BIDSify_7T.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/BIDS/BIDS_heudiconv/BIDSify_7T.sh) script.

In order to check the acquisition parameters for the structural MP2RAGE data acquired for this study, Curation of BIDS on Disk ([CuBIDS](https://cubids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html)) was run with [/BIDS/CuBIDS/cubids_acquisition_group.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/BIDS/CuBIDS/cubids_acquisition_group.sh).  

### Processing of MP2RAGE-Derived UNI Images
MP2RAGE-derived T1w Uniform (UNI) images were denoised off of the scanner and then corrected for residual B1+ transmit field biases using SPM's [UNICORT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910013157) algorithm. UNICORT was applied in [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_inhomogeneitycorrection_UNI.m](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_inhomogeneitycorrection_UNI.m) using the configuration parameters specified in [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_configparams_UNI.m](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_configparams_UNI.m). UNICORT outputs were organized and the B1-corrected image was put into the BIDS directory for use with BIDS apps via [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/organize_unicort_files.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/organize_unicort_files.sh).

Following UNICORT, corrected UNI images were run through FreeSurfer to generate person-specific cortical surface reconstructions to map R1 data to. Images were processed with FreeSurfer's longitudinal analysis stream (FS version 7.4.1) using a containerized [FreeSurfer BIDS App](https://github.com/bids-apps/freesurfer). FreeSurfer was run on the Pittsburgh Super Computer by submitting subject-specific jobs via slurm/sbatch. Jobs were submitted with the script [/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/freesurfer_submitjobs_PSC.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/freesurfer_submitjobs_PSC.sh), which calls [/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/longitudinal_freesurfer_call.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/longitudinal_freesurfer_call.sh). Cross-sectional, template, and longitudinal steps of recon-all were run for all subjects (and sessions). Job completion was checked with [/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/check_freesurferjobs_complete.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/longitudinal_freesurfer/check_freesurferjobs_complete.sh). 
 
### Processing of MP2RAGE-Derived R1 Maps
MP2RAGE-derived quantitative T1 maps were corrected for B1+ transmit field biases using UNICORT by running [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_inhomogeneitycorrection_T1map.m](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_inhomogeneitycorrection_T1map.m), which uses [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_configparams_T1map.m](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/unicort_configparams_T1map.m) as the config file. UNICORT output files were renamed and organized with [/image_processing/B1+\_transmitfield_correction/unicort/organize_unicort_files_T1map.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/B1%2B_transmitfield_correction/unicort/organize_unicort_files_T1map.sh).

UNICORT-corrected quantitative T1 maps were next converted into volumetric R1 maps (s^-1). R1 maps were calculated in [/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/R1_volumetricmaps.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/R1_volumetricmaps.sh) by coverting the T1 readout from ms to s and then calculating R1 = 1/T1. Volumetric R1 maps were then projected to participant-specific cortical surfaces on the PSC by running [/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/R1_vol2surf_submitjobs_PSC.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/R1_vol2surf_submitjobs_PSC.sh). This script calls [/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/voltosurf_projection_nativefsaverage.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/R1_surfacemaps/voltosurf_projection_nativefsaverage.sh) for every session in order to project R1 data to the surface at 11 projection fractions: 0 (GM/WM boundary), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 (pial boundary). 
 
### Calculation of Anatomical and R1-based Measures
After running FreeSurfer and projecting depth-dependent R1 data to the cortical surface, anatomical metrics (cortical thickness, cortical curvature) and depth-dependent R1 metrics were quantified in individual cortical regions using atlases of interest. This was accomplished by running [/surface_metrics/fstabulate/fstabulate_R1anat_submitjobs_PSC.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/fstabulate/fstabulate_R1anat_submitjobs_PSC.sh), which ultimately uses the shell and python scripts in [/surface_metrics/fstabulate](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/tree/main/surface_metrics/fstabulate).

The workhorse script directly called via fstabulate_R1anat_submitjobs_PSC.sh is [/surface_metrics/fstabulate/collect_stats_to_tsv.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/fstabulate/collect_stats_to_tsv.sh). This script parses user-defined inputs and warps fsaverage parcellations to native space, runs FreeSurfer's qcache + mris_anatomical_stats + mri_segstats to get regional metrics of interest, and converts metric stats files to tsvs. After fstabulate_R1anat_submitjobs_PSC.sh completed, [/surface_metrics/surface_measures/collate_study_anatomicalstats.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/surface_measures/collate_study_anatomicalstats.py) was run to combine session-specific tsv metric files into study parquet files with all participants' anatomical and depth-dependent R1 data in atlases of interest. These parquets were used to generate final input dataframes for statistical modeling. 


## Image Processing Pipeline: EEG Aperiodic Activity

### Creation of an EEG Electrode Cortical Surface Atlas
This project examines relationships between cortical R1 and EEG-derived measures of aperiodic activity. In order to compare aperiodic activity in individual electrodes with R1 in cortical locations proximal to each electrode, we created a surface atlas of EEG electrode positions. EEG electrode labels were created in MNI space for our 64 channel EEG cap, mapped to the fsaverage cortical surface, and warped to participant-specific surfaces for R1 quantification. The creation of the EEG electrode atlas was done through [/surface_metrics/EEGelectrode_atlas/EEGatlas_fsaverage_annots.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/EEGelectrode_atlas/EEGatlas_fsaverage_annots.sh), which internally calls [/surface_metrics/EEGelectrode_atlas/EEGatlas_fsaverage_giftis.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/EEGelectrode_atlas/EEGatlas_fsaverage_giftis.py). 

### Quantification of Aperiodic Activity
The EEG aperiodic activity measures used in this project were initially derived in [McKeon et al., 2024, DCN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324000343?via%3Dihub). Code for preprocessing and parameterization of aperiodic activity are available here: [https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/Aperiodic_MRS_Development](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/7T_EEG) along with [a guide to code implementation](https://labneurocogdevel.github.io/Aperiodic_MRS_Development).

Preprocessing was done through 01_Aperiodic_Preprocessing.sh and the aperiodic component of the power spectrum was parameterized using FOOOF via 02_runFOOOF.py, 03_ExtractFOOOFmeasures.py, and 04_CreateFOOOFdataframes.R. Raw aperiodic activity measures were then cleaned (including the exlusion of electrodes with high spectral fit errors, low R2, and outlier values) and averaged across nearby electrodes for this project in [/image_processing/EEG_aperiodic/fooof_aperiodicactivity.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/EEG_aperiodic/fooof_aperiodicactivity.R). The main analysis used the EEG electrode cortical surface atlas described above. A sensitivity analysis was additionally performed using aperiodic measures averaged in Brodmann regions (see [/image_processing/EEG_aperiodic/fooof_aperiodicactivity_brodmann.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/EEG_aperiodic/fooof_aperiodicactivity_brodmann.R)). 

## Sample Construction

### Construction of Final Sample 
The initial developmental dataset considered for inclusion in this project was comprised of 264 longitudinal sessions (with correctly acquired, i.e. CuBIDS non-variant, UNI and quantitative T1 images) from 159 healthy participants. Sessions were iteratively excluded for:

* failing visual quality control of UNI and R1 images (44 sessions/18 subjects excluded) 
* being collected within 6 months of another session that passed QC (4 sessions/0 subjects excluded)
* having a whole-brain mean R1 > 4 SD above the group mean (1 session/1 subject excluded)

This resulted in a final sample of 215 longitudinal sessions collected from 140 individuals, finalized in [/sample_construction/finalsample_7Tmyelin.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/sample_construction/finalsample_7Tmyelin.Rmd).

### Generation of Final Input Dataframes
After determining the final study sample (final subject and session lists), [/surface_metrics/surface_measures/extract_depthdependent_R1.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/surface_measures/extract_depthdependent_R1.R) was run in order to extract depth-specific R1 measures from cortical atlas regions (HCP-MMP atlas and EEG electrode surface atlas) for the final study sample. The extract_depthdependent_R1.R script parses parquets (generated by collate_study_anatomicalstats.py) using the flexible [/surface_metrics/surface_measures/extract_surfacestats.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/surface_measures/extract_surfacestats.R) function and produces RDS files with R1 measures for the final sample that are used for statistical modeling. This includes both depth-wise R1 and superficial, middle, deep R1. 

## Statistical Analysis: Model Fitting with GAMMs
This project used generalized additive mixed models (GAMs with random intercepts) to characterize developmental change in R1 and to model associations between R1 and both EEG activity and cognitive measures. A series of GAMM fitting functions from [/gam_models/gam_functions.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/gam_functions.R) were used throughout analyses, all which use *gam* from the mgcv package. gam_functions.R contains the following functions:

* **gam.statistics.smooths**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with one smooth (*s(x)*) plus optional id-based random effect terms and save out 1) model statistics, 2) spline-derived characteristics, 3) fitted values for the smooth from a prediction df, 4) zero-centered smooth fits, and 5) the instantaneous first derivative of the smooth. This function was used to fit most developmental models in main and sensitivity analyses 
* **gam.agebysex.interaction**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with a factor-smooth interaction (*s(x) + s(x, by = y) + y*) and save out interaction statistics. This was used to fit age-by-sex interaction models
* **gam.tensorproduct.interaction**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with an explictly modeled tensor product interaction term (*s(x) + s(y) + ti(x,y)*) and optional random intercepts or random intercepts + slopes. This was used to fit age-by-depth interaction models
* **gam.linearcovariate.maineffect**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with a main smooth plus a linear covariate of interest (*s(x) + y*) and save out statistics for the covariate term. This was used to test for main effects of sex
* **gam.covariatesmooth.maineffect**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with a main smooth plus a smooth for a covariate of interest (*s(x) + s(y)*) and save out statistics for the covariate smooth. This was used for quantifying relationships of R1 with aperiodic activity and cognitive measures 
* **gam.factorsmooth.interaction**: A function to fit a GAM(M) with a main smooth plus a factor-smooth interaction for a second smooth term (*s(x) + s(y) + s(y, by = z)*) and save out main effects and interaction results. This was used to test for superficial/deep depth interactions 

These functions were applied in a series of scripts included in the /gam_models directory to model developmental effects ([/gam_models/fit_ageGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/fit_ageGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R) and [/gam_models/fit_agedepth_interactionGAMs_glasserregions.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/tree/main/gam_models)), to conduct sensitivity analyses ([/gam_models/fit_sensitivityGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/fit_sensitivityGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R)), to examine relationships with EEG ([/gam_models/fit_eegGAMS_electrodeatlas_bydepth.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/fit_eegGAMS_electrodeatlas_bydepth.R)), and to characterize cognitive links ([gam_models/fit_cognitionGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/fit_cognitionGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R)). 

## Statistical Analysis: BrainSmash
This project quantifies across-region correlations between brain maps, including whole-brain correlations between R1 and a multi-modal myelin map, whole-brain correlations between R1 laminar profile measures derived from 1 mm and 0.5 mm resolution data, and frontal lobe-only correlations between developmental maps and cortical hierarchy. To determine the statistical significance of these spatial correlations, autocorrelation preserving null models were constructed using [BrainSmash](https://brainsmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The procedure to compute correlation p-values with BrainSmash nulls requires 1. a parcellated distance matrix for your cortical atlas of interest, and 2. parcellated brain maps (empirical) to use for creating spatial autocorrelation-preserving surrogate maps (nulls).

The distance matrix (1) was created by first deriving a vertex-wise geodesic distance matrix for left and right cortical surfaces with [/results/brainsmash_nulls/compute_dense_geodesicdistmat.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/compute_dense_geodesicdistmat.py) and then parcellating it with the HCP-MMP atlas in [/results/brainsmash_nulls/compute_parcellated_geodesicdistmat.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/compute_parcellated_geodesicdistmat.py); a frontal lobe-only distance matrix was generated in [/results/brainsmash_nulls/mask_parcellated_distmat_frontallobe.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/mask_parcellated_distmat_frontallobe.R).

Surrogate maps (2) were created for whole-brain R1, whole-brain laminar skewness, and whole-brain laminar coefficient of variation using the [create surrogate map python scripts](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls).

## Results: Quantitative Imaging of Myelin 

### Cortical Myeloarchitecture Characterization
R1 was validated in our sample as a quantitative 7T imaging measure capable of capturing variation in myelin levels across cortical regions and superficial, middle, and deep cortical compartments. Characterization of R1-based myeloarchitecture was conducted in [/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture.Rmd). This script shows spatial variation in R1 and its alignment with a multi-modal myelin map derived from a PCA applied to a developmental T1w/T2w ratio map, a developmental MT saturartion map, and an adult myelin basic protein gene expression map. It additionally compares laminar profiles, laminar cov, and laminar skewness of R1 between our 1mm R1 data and data collected with 0.5mm resolution and demonstrates the capacity for R1 data to distinguish signal in 3 cortical ribbon compartments (superficial, middle, and deep). Finally, it uses the second derivative and a change point analysis applied to relationships between R1 and depth in 0.5mm resolution data to determine where to draw the boundaries between superficial, middle, and deep compartments. 

[A rendered version of this R markdown is available here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture.html)!

The above code utilizes a myelin basic protein gene expression map. Myelin basic protein gene expression was obtained from vertex-level gene expression data generated from the AHBA by [Wagstyl et al., 2023, elife](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/86933v1). The script [/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/myelin_maps/create_AHBAmagicc_genemap.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/myelin_maps/create_AHBAmagicc_genemap.sh) gets MBP gene maps by interfacing with [/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/myelin_maps/create_AHBAmagicc_genemap.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_corticalmyelin_anatomy/myelin_maps/create_AHBAmagicc_genemap.py) to pull gene expression and gene info csvs and produce a parcellated MBP cifti.

### BrainSmash Significance
The significance of the correlation between regional R1 and myelin PC1 was assessed using autocorrelation-preserving R1 surrogates generated (detailed above) via BrainSmash. Visualization of example surrogates and significance testing was executed in [/results/brainsmash_nulls/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture_brainsmash.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture_brainsmash.Rmd) which [can be viewed here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/R1_cortical_myeloarchitecture_brainsmash.html). 

The significance of correlations between region-wise laminar COV and laminar skewness in R1 in 1mm and 0.5mm data was assessed using autocorrelation-preserving surrogates as well. Rendered .html files with significance results are available in [/results/brainsmash_nulls/](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/brainsmash_nulls/) 

## Results: Heterochronous and Hierarchical Myelin Maturation in the Human PFC

### Heterochronous and Hierarchical Laminar Myelination in the Human PFC
Heterochronous myelin maturation in the human frontal cortex was investigated in [/results/R1_depth_development/R1_depthdevelopment.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_depth_development/R1_depthdevelopment.Rmd). This markdown file examines trajectories of myelin development across superficial, middle, and deep cortex, elucidates regional differences in the rate and timing of myelin maturation across cortical compartments and their hierarchical spatial embedding, and functionally characterizes the principal component of variation in ribbon developmental trajectories. [A rendered version of this R markdown is available here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_depth_development/R1_depthdevelopment.html#frontal-cortex-myelin-developmental-trajectories-vary-by-cortical-depth)! R1_depthdevelopment.Rmd was paired with [/results/R1_depth_development/R1_sexdifferences.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_depth_development/R1_sexdifferences.Rmd), which is [knitted here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_depth_development/R1_sexdifferences.html), to examine whether developmental trajectories differed by sex. 

## Results: Sensitivity Analyses
A series of sensitivity analyses were undertaken to ensure that developmental results were not driven by individual differences in sex, structural data quality, or cortical architecture. Sensitivity GAMMs were all fit in [/gam_models/results/fit_sensitivityGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/gam_models/fit_sensitivityGAMs_glasserregions_bydepth.R) and then examined separately in /results/R1_sensitivity_analyses scripts as explained below. 

### Biological Sex
Developmental models were covaried for sex and developmental results were examined in [/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_sex.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_sex.Rmd) which is [knitted for visualization here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_sex.html).

### Structural Data Quality
Developmental models were covaried for euler number and developmental results were examined in [/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_euler.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_euler.Rmd) which is [knitted here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_euler.html). The euler number was computed by FreeSurfer's mris_anatomical_stats, which is run as part of the R1 and Anatomical Measure Extraction pipeline.

### Cortical Thickness
Developmental models were covaried for regional cortical thickness and developmental results were examined in [/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_corticalthickness.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_corticalthickness.Rmd) which is [knitted here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_corticalthickness.html). Cortical thickness was computed by FreeSurfer's mris_anatomical_stats in every HCP-MMP region for every participant.

### Cortical Curvature
Developmental models were covaried for regional curvature and developmental results were examined in [/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_curvature.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_curvature.Rmd) which is [knitted here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_curvature.html). Curvature represents FreeSurfer's mean curvature measure, which varies according to folding properties and gyral versus sulcal location. 

### Cortex Fraction (PVE) 
Developmental models were covaried for regional cortex fraction (quantified at each depth) and developmental results were examined in [/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_cortexfraction.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_cortexfraction.Rmd) which is [knitted here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_sensitivity_analyses/R1_sensitivity_cortexfraction.html). The cortex fraction was calculated in each region at every cortical depth by first estimating the cortex tissue fraction in volumetric space (i.e., the percent of each voxel occupied by cortex) using FreeSurfer's mri_compute_volume_fractions, which was applied via [/image_processing/cortexfraction_surfacemaps/cortexfraction_volumetricmaps.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/cortexfraction_surfacemaps/cortexfraction_volumetricmaps.sh). Volumetric cortex fraction maps were then projected to participant-specific cortical surfaces at varying depths in [/image_processing/cortexfraction_surfacemaps/cortexfraction_vol2surf.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/image_processing/cortexfraction_surfacemaps/cortexfraction_vol2surf.sh) and the average cortex fraction in each region (at each depth) was computed with [/surface_metrics/fstabulate/fstabulate_cortexpve_submitjobs_PSC.sh](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/fstabulate/fstabulate_cortexpve_submitjobs_PSC.sh) followed by [/surface_metrics/surface_measures/collate_cortexpve_stats.py](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/surface_metrics/surface_measures/collate_cortexpve_stats.py).
 
## Results: Cortical Myelin Supports E/I-linked Neural Dynamics 

### Associations Between Superficial and Deep R1 and EEG Aperiodic Activity
Relationships between superficial and deep cortex R1 and EEG-derived aperiodic parameters were studied in [/results/R1_EEG_relationships/R1_aperiodicactivity_associations.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_EEG_relationships/R1_aperiodicactivity_associations.Rmd). This markdown presents developmental changes in the aperiodic slope in four cortical territories, quantifies depth-specific relationships between R1 and the aperiodic exponent and offset, and tests for depth interactions in R1-EEG relationships. [A rendered version of this R markdown is available here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_EEG_relationships/R1_aperiodicactivity_associations.html)! A sensitivity analysis mapping R1 to EEG signals via Brodmann regions was conducted in [/results/R1_EEG_relationships/R1_aperiodicactivity_associations_brodmann.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_EEG_relationships/R1_aperiodicactivity_associations_brodmann.Rmd) based on [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8865144/). 

## Results: Cortical Myelin Impacts Learning Rate and Cognitive Processing Speed

### Associations Between Cortical R1 and Cognitive Abilities
We studied relationships between superficial and deep cortex R1 and cognitive subprocesses, including learning rates and processing speeds. Cognitive testing utilized a two-stage sequential decision-making task, an anti-saccade task, and a visually-guided saccade test (the latter 2 tests used for specificity analyses). Learning rates were obtained by fitting a 7-parameter reinforcement learning model to trial-level data on the sequential decision-making task; a seperate learning rate was obtained for each of the 2 stages of the task. Cognitive processing speed was proxied by the average across-trial response time on each of the 2 stages of the task.

Analyses examining the influence of cortical R1 on cognitive measures are presented in [/results/R1_cognition_relationships/R1_cognition_associations.Rmd](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/corticalmyelin_maturation/blob/main/results/R1_cognition_relationships/R1_cognition_associations.Rmd). This markdown explores developmental changes in learning rate and processing speed on both stages of the task and characterizes depth-specific and across-depth relationships between R1 and cognitive measures. It furthermore includes Neurosynth decoding of brain regions where myelin is linked to learning rates and a specificity analysis using anti-saccade and visually-guided saccade data.
