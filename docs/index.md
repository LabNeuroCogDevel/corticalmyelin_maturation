### Project Directories
The project directory on rhea is: **/Volumes/Hera/Projects/corticalmyelin_development**

The directory structure on rhea is as follows:

```
BIDS: BIDS-compliant MP2RAGE data
BIDS/derivatives: Processed image derivatives including unicort-corrected UNI and T1 maps, volumetric R1 maps, and surface measures
Dicoms: Organized dicoms for BIDSifying
EEG: EEG aperiodic activity spreadsheets
Figures: Manuscript figure panels
Maps: Brain maps galore! HCPMPP atlas, S-A axis, Neurosynth z-score maps, AHBA dense gene expression, cytoarchitectural variation, MWF imaging, and templateflow templates
code: local clone of corticalmyelin_maturation repo
gam_outputs: Gam-derived statistics (developmental_effects, sex_effects, sensitivity_analyses, eeg_associations, cognitive_associations)
sample_info: sample demographics, behavioral data, imaging QC and final participant lists
software/: Directory with project software installs and containers
```

The project directory on the PSC is: **/ocean/projects/soc230004p/shared/datasets/7TBrainMech**
